## Welcome to the SMARCQL Ontology

SPARQL + MARC = SMARCQL

The general idea of using SPARQL to index MARC is introduced in 
this [Hanging Together](https://hangingtogether.org/how-marc-can-sparql/) blog post.

This site is dedicated to publishing the SMARCQL ontology, which is located 
[here](https://w3id.org/smarcql/). (Just a stub for now, but with more to come.)

The code and instructions to create and index SMARCQL from MARC/XML records is
located [here](https://github.com/realworldobject/smarcql).
