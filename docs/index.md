## Welcome to SMARCQL Pages

SPARQL + MARC = SMARCQL

(These pages are just stubs for now, but hopefully things will develop quickly.)

The general idea of using SPARQL to index MARC is introduced in 
this [Hanging Together](https://hangingtogether.org/how-marc-can-sparql/) blog post.
The purpose here is to explore and share an implementation solution.

A stub for the SMARCQL ontology is located [here](https://w3id.org/smarcql/), with more details to come soon.
