## Welcome to the SMARCQL Ontology

SPARQL + MARC = SMARCQL

The general idea of using SPARQL to index MARC is introduced in 
this [Hanging Together](https://hangingtogether.org/how-marc-can-sparql/) blog post.

As a way for formalizing the idea, this site is dedicated to defining and describing a 
[SMARCQL Ontology](https://w3id.org/smarcql/). 
(This is just a stub for now, but with more to come.)

Code and instructions to create and index MARC/RDF ("SMARCQL") output from existing
MARC/XML input records is available as a Github repository [here](https://github.com/realworldobject/smarcql).

Interested parties are welcomed and encouraged to improve this formaliation by 
creating new issue tickets [here](https://github.com/realworldobject/smarcql/issues).
